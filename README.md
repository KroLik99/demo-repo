# demo-repo

This is a test to checkout GitHub.

## Change to test a commit
This is a change to try out how to commit the file. I have created a repo on GitHub and a README.md file. This has then been transferred via GitHub Desktop to VS Code. To commit I need to add git push.

## Now I am adding this to GitHub
I will have to update the local file. By clicking the 3 dots on source control and clicking pull, push and then sync I managed to get the changes onto our local file.

## Updated the local File
Again I update this file.
